        <h2>What is <a href="https://nationalchildrensmuseum.org/explore/exhibits/climate-action-heroes">Climate Action
                Heroes</a>?</h2>
        <p>Climate Action Heroes is an exhibit created by the National Children's Museu featuring superhero identities
            that patrons can embody.
            There are 5 superheroes that kids can be: Community Captain, Pollinator Patrol, Arbor Avenger, Water
            Warrior, and Mighty Meteorologist.</p>

        <h2>What are the monthly missions?</h2>
        <p>Monthly Missions are tasks given by the museum to our Climate Action Heroes to complete. Some of these
            missions can be found on the website <a href="https://www.climate-heroes.org/monthly-missions">here</a>.</p>

        <h2>A Shift in the Model</h2>
        <p>During my internship, rather than do one mission for all 5 heroes per month, the museum shifted the model to
            be
            1 per hero per month. I was tasked with creating a year's worth of missions for the website.</p>

        <h2>My Ideology</h2>
        <p>For each mission, I ensured that they were nature and conservation themed. I also wanted the missions to be
            on topic for each hero and their theme. For example, Mighty Meteorologist missions are generally about
            weather and the atmosphere, while Pollinator Patrol missions are about bugs and plants.<br>
            I wanted the activities to be for all ages (grades K - 5). This would be metered through their grown ups’
            discretion and participation.<br>
            Lastly, we wanted kids to not feel pressured to save the world themselves! Sometimes just being and taking
            in nature is enough to connect with it and inspire change. We didn’t want to set a precedent of personal
            responsibility.</p>
