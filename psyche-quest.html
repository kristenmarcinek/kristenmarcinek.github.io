            Psyche Quest is a 2D platformer that takes players on a journey through the mind of someone with Borderline
            Personality Disorder (BPD).

        <p>You play as the imaginary friend of the protagonist who must navigate your friend's mind. Each level
            represents different effects borderline personality disorder has on the brain. Along the way, the player
            uncovers the protagonist's memories, emotions, and experiences, shedding light on the impacts BPD has on
            mental health.</p>

        <p>Backgrounds for each level, visually representing how each area of the brain is affected by BPD while
            maintaining a brain matter-esque color scheme.</p>

        <h2>Level Design</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Amygdala: The amygdala regulates fear and aggression. For people with BPD, their amygdalae are
                noticeably
                smaller than average and thus feel fear and anger more intensely. This level is horror-inspired.
            </li>
            <li>Hippocampus: Being the body's data processor, the hippocampus deals with memory formation, spatial
                orientation, and emotional reactions. For people with BPD, their hippocampi are commonly in a state of
                hyperarousal. This manifests in people with BPD perceiving friends and family as more threatening and
                social interactions as more negative. With dizzying gameplay and fake platforms in this level, not
                everything is as it seems.</li>
            <li>Prefrontal Cortex: Responsible for reason, rationality, and decision-making, prefrontal cortexes for
                people with BPD are often inactive and inefficient, causing impulsive actions. To simulate this, this
                level tests the players patience with high speed character movement mixed with slow speed environments.
                Passing through portals in the game mirrors life's spontaneous decisions. Rushing through them can lead
                to unforeseen challenges, emphasizing how impulsivity can result in regrettable outcomes.</li>
            <li>HPA Axis: The HPA axis is the neural pathway within the brain that deals with reactions to stress and
                maintaining cortisol levels. People with BPD are often found with high levels of cortisol in their
                bloodstreams. Players must swim through the stress before time runs out.</li>
        </ol>
