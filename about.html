                    As a game designer, I aim to prod at the boundaries of the magic circle; to fuse interactivity,
                    nature, gameplay, technology, and human relationships. Like other forms of design, I see game design
                    as an artform, which inherently allows it to be a creative outlet. Through my creations, I explore
                    the self, both the outward self and the inward ego, and how that self can be communicated to
                    players. I believe that expressions of self, or of one’s beliefs, are inherently embedded in the
                    design of a game’s systems. This may come out more consciously as a form of artistic expression, or
                    subconsciously in design decisions. Likewise, I generally don't see entertainment and education in a
                    hierarchy. My designs do not have
                    to
                    prioritize one over the other; they can work synergistically. I am passionate about providing
                    non-traditional educational experiences and
                    accurately representing intersectional and marginalized lenses while balancing the abstract, the creative, and
                    the immersive.

                <p>I am currently a student at American University working towards my MFA in Games and
                    Interactive Media. My research focus is subverting the horror genre as a form of transformational
                    game design. During my time here, I taught DC-area youth ages 14 to 24 game development in
                    partnership with Anacostia Youth Media and Covenant House and
                    interned
                    with The Wilson Center in Washington, DC in their Serious Games Initiative. Prior to the Wilson
                    Center, I interned with the National Children’s Museum as an Exhibits Intern. I received
                    my
                    BA in Information Technology and Informatics from Rutgers University – New Brunswick in 2022, where I
                    also
                    minored in Social Justice. During my time at Rutgers, I was the President of Reproductive
                    Health
                    Universal Taskforce, an organization partnered with the Friends of UNFPA; the Vice President and
                    a
                    founding member of Rutgers Women’s Gaming League; and interned with the New Jersey Division on
                    Women
                    where I performed analysis on legislation surrounding batterer intervention programs and
                    criminal
                    justice reform for incarcerated women in New Jersey.</p>
